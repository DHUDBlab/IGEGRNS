# Inferring gene regulatory networks based on graph embedding Inferring gene regulatory networks inference from single-cell transcriptomics based on graph embedding

## Abstract

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) encode gene regulation in living organisms, and have become a critical tool to understand complex biological processes. However, due to the dynamic and complex nature of gene regulation, inferring GRNs from scRNA-seq data is still a challenging task. Existing computational methods usually focus on the close connections between genes, and ignore the global structure and distal regulatory relationships. Here, we develop a supervised deep learning framework, IGEGRNS, to infer gene regulatory networks from scRNA-seq data based on graph embedding. In the framework, contextual information of genes is captured by GraphSAGE, which aggregates gene features and neighborhood structures to generate low-dimensional embedding for genes. Then, the k most influential nodes in the whole graph are filtered through top-k pooling. Finally, potential regulatory relationships between genes are predicted by stacking CNNs. Compared with eight competing supervised and unsupervised methods, our method achieves better performance on six time-series scRNA-seq datasets.
